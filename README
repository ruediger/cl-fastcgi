cl-fastcgi is a Common Lisp library for FastCGI. I wrote the library in 2006 with SBCL 0.9.14 and tested it with lighttpd. Because I stopped working on the project the library was intended for development has ceased and it is not very well tested. Maybe the code is still useful to somebody else. Therefore I moved the code from monotone to git and published it on github.
